## Overview
AnimoHealth by Whalbytes is a clinic appointment booking application designed for De La Salle University (DLSU). This application streamlines the process of scheduling and managing various medical appointments for university students and staff.

## Repository Version Control Approach

**Important Note**: This repository uses a unique version control strategy:

- Each group member is expected to contribute to the latest version of the project, one by one
- After making their modifications, members upload the updated project as a ZIP archive and provide a brief description of the changes in the group chat
- This git repository is primarily used for **storing complete project snapshots** as ZIP files
- Both new and old versions of the complete codebase are maintained as ZIP archives
- The repository serves as a backup and version storage system rather than utilizing git-based version control for individual file changes
- Each ZIP file contains the entire project code at a specific point in time

This approach allows for straightforward rollback to previously completed versions while preserving a clear, well-structured archive of the application's evolution.
