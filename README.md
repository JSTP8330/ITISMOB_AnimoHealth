## Repository Version Control Approach

**Important Note**: This repository uses a unique version control strategy:

- This git repository is primarily used for **storing complete project snapshots** as ZIP files
- Both new and old versions of the complete codebase are maintained as ZIP archives
- The repository serves as a backup and version storage system rather than utilizing traditional git-based version control for individual file changes
- Each ZIP file contains the entire project code at a specific point in time

This approach allows for easy rollback to previous complete versions and maintains a clear archive of the application's evolution.
