## Repository Version Control Approach

**Important Note**: This repository uses a unique version control strategy:

- This git repository is primarily used for **storing complete project snapshots** as ZIP files
- Both new and old versions of the complete codebase are maintained as ZIP archives
- The repository serves as a backup and version storage system rather than utilizing traditional git-based version control for individual file changes
- Each ZIP file contains the entire project code at a specific point in time

This approach allows for easy rollback to previous complete versions and maintains a clear archive of the application's evolution.

## About
The application is a clinic appointment app – AnimoHealth, designed for the use within the clinic under the DLSU Health Services Office. It allows appointees to sign-in with their university emails to book clinic appointments - whether it be for the dentist’s appointment, or for their required drug testing/physical examinations as such. 

Appointees can view available appointment slots, filter by exam type and date, and reserve a time that fits their schedule. Once an appointment is booked, it is automatically added to the student’s device calendar with reminders set days before the appointment. On the day of the appointment, students can check in by scanning a QR code or through location verification at the clinic. 

After completing their exam, students are prompted to confirm their attendance and receive a digital clearance certificate stored within the app. More information about this can be found in the Google Docs link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nipQ4eRh9u8172YDr5QGfNjxefkOr1pMGHESqvTD50w/edit?usp=sharing
